# Japa's Spigot Launcher
**Disclaimer: You should be able to use any JAR like CraftBukkit, Spigot, Paper and BungeeCoord. The program is called Spigot Launcher just for convenience**
**(any type of JAR should work, but JARs not meant for this program are strongly discouraged).**

This is a small tool that i made ~~because im lazy and i have too much free time~~ to help Server Admins initialize their server on Windows (You can try building on Linux, i haven't tested it).

## Uses for this program
- Instead of having multiple BATCH files that you have to edit every time you download a new JAR (unless you rename the JAR or you use Terminal) you can use this tool to launch your server.
- If you use Spigot, the program also automatically updates the JAR for you (can be toggled).
- Launch JARs dynamically based on preffix.
